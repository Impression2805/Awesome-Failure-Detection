# Awesome Failure Detection / Reliable Prediction / Confidence Estimation

Failure Detection is a machine learning problem, which aims detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) and misclassified samples based on reliable confidence estimation. This topic is important for for risk-sensitive applications (e.g., autonomous driving, clinical decision making, and is gathering much attention in the research community.

Here, we provide a list of papers that studies OOD detection and misclassification detection (MisD)
